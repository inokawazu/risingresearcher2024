I am theoretical physicist from the USA with a background in applied holography.
I currently live in Sendai, Japan working as JSPS postdoc fellow at Yamagata University.

I have obtained my PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Alabama in 2021.
I have held several private/academic positions, including my current JSPS Postdoc at Yamagata University (2023-present), technical consultant role at Quantum Data Center (2022-2023), and a postdoc at Henan University (2022-2023).

My research focuses on applied holography mainly.
My published research has been focused on applications in condensed matter, QCD, and topological field theory. 
My research objective is to continue to build more accurate gravitational models of real world physics.
I also am interested in exploring the interesting geometric and physical properties of holographic on both sides of the duality.

My hobbies include mataining a blog, playing video games, and learning Japanese.
My personal goals are to write a relatively popular article (1k views would be nice) and to obtain N1 (JLPT certification) in Japanese.
