My name is Markus A.G. Amano.
I am a theoretical physicist from the USA with a background in applied holography.
I currently live in Sendai, Japan, working as a JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) postdoc fellow at Yamagata University.

I obtained my PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Alabama in 2021.
I have held several private/academic positions, including my current JSPS Postdoc at Yamagata University (2023-present), a technical consultant role at Quantum Data Center (2022-2023), and a postdoc at Henan University (2022-2023).

My research focuses mainly on applied holography; holography is a physics duality that relates a theory of gravity to a quantum field theory in a lower number of dimensions.
My published research has been focused on applications in condensed matter, QCD, and topological field theory.
My research objective is to continue to build more accurate gravitational models of real-world physics.
I am also interested in exploring the interesting geometric and physical properties of holography on both sides of the duality.

My hobbies include maintaining a blog, playing video games, and learning Japanese.
My personal goals are to write a relatively popular article (1k views would be nice) and to obtain the N1 level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) certification in Japanese.
