In this multi-year research, rotating Anti-de Sitter spacetimes are applied to model quark-gluon-like plasmas typical in heavy ion collisions. 
Employing AdS/CFT correspondence, we present a stationary, rotating, strongly coupled conformal plasma, modeled as a dual to a 5D Myers-Perry Anti-de Sitter Black Hole. 
We derive and calculate the plasma's long and short-wavelength spectra, distinguished as hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic modes, based on linear perturbations in the 5D gravitational theory. 
These perturbations, correlating to 4D plasma fluctuations, yield distinct quasinormal modes, identified as eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian operator. 
Our investigation explores the application of hydrodynamics to these plasmas, particularly under rotational conditions including near-extremality. 
We computed the radius of convergence for hydrodynamic regimes, derived explicit hydrodynamic dispersion relations with boosted fluid transport coefficients, parameterized with momentum and vorticity. 
The study verifies the physical behavior of modeled plasmas, ensuring stability and causality across all temperatures and non-subluminal vorticities, aligning with prior findings on relativistic fluids. 
Additionally, we explore novel behaviors in the non-hydrodynamic spectrum under rotation, such as critical points, mode decay enhancement or suppression, and multiple level crossings between non-hydrodynamic modes. 
The emergence of branch cuts in holographic fluids at extremality, analogous to those in charged holographic fluids, is also observed.
